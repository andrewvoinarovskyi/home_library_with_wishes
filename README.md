The main idea of ​​this project is to create a single place to organize my board games, books, and other hobbies.
This is so that I can quickly and anywhere review the things I own, and also share this list with others.


My mom recently wanted to give me and my partner a board game, but she didn't know what games I already had.
In the end, she had to ask for every idea she had, and we didn't have this holiday surprise, because we were directly involved in choosing the gift.
So, the main idea of ​​this project is to create The One place to organize my board games, books, and other hobbies that will appear in the future and they could be listed.
This is necessary for me to view a list of things I own quickly and anywhere, as well as share this list with others.

The second stage of development of this project will be the ability to create a wish list, as well as a list of dislikes, with the ability to share them.
The first one will probably include a rating system so that people can get an idea of ​​what from the list I would like to get the most.

I would also like to add user registration at some point so that it benefits more people, who also have the same problem.
Different categories to filter the lists, such as price range, genre, type will be here too.

Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the project is called a library, so I would like to add the ability to "borrow" items from my collection.
Of course, in the near future it will be a simple note (made by the owner of the item) on the item that it is "borrowed" (and sometimes by whom),
but I do not exclude that someday it will be a small CRM system or integration where you can submit requests for items.
But for now, I have no more than twenty items at my disposal, so it's too early to say. (It's easier and faster to ask directly)
